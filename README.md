# INTERACT

There is more than just chat: Elegant UI components for AI-driven operations.

## Purpose

This repository aims to support system builders to integrate generic ai in a thoughtful and sustainable manner into software projects, through interaction paradigm abstraction. Human AI Interaction has a variety of challenges outside of the classical chat interfaces and we want to support you addressing those challenges in your existing applications.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Define the key dimensions for gen ai components
- [ ] Build central logic into a (hopfully agnostic) core module
- [ ] Build react adapters
