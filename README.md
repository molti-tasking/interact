> There is more than just chat: Elegant UI components for AI-driven operations.

---

## Purpose

This repository aims to support system builders to integrate generic AI in a thoughtful and sustainable manner into software projects, through interaction paradigm abstraction. Human-AI interaction has a variety of challenges outside of the classical chat interfaces, and we want to support you in addressing those challenges in your existing applications.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Define the key dimensions for gen AI components
- [ ] Build central logic into a (hopefully agnostic) core module
- [ ] Build React adapters
 

## Contributing

Conceptual input is welcome! We are also looking for examples and further use cases to implement our ideas.
